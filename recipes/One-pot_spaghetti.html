    <h2><i>Description</i></h2>
    <p>
        One-pot spaghetti is a simple and convenient cooking method where all ingredients—spaghetti, 
        sauce, vegetables, and seasonings—are cooked together in a single pot. This technique allows 
        the pasta to absorb flavors while cooking, resulting in a rich, cohesive dish. It’s quick to 
        prepare and minimizes cleanup, making it a favorite for busy weeknight dinners. Just combine 
        everything, bring it to a boil, simmer, and enjoy a delicious, satisfying meal!

    <h3>Steps:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>
            In a large pot, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add chopped onion and minced garlic, and
            sauté until the onion is translucent.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir in the crushed tomatoes, broth, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper. If using vegetables 
            or protein, add them now.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the uncooked spaghetti, making sure it’s submerged in the liquid.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer. Cook for about 10-12 minutes, 
            stirring occasionally, until the pasta is al dente and the liquid has mostly absorbed.
        </li>
        <li>
            Taste and adjust seasoning if needed.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove from heat and let it sit for a couple of minutes. Garnish with fresh basil or parsley 
            before serving.
        </li>
    </ol>
