    <h3>Steps:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>
            If you’re serving with pasta, cook according to package instructions. Drain and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium-high heat. Season the chicken with salt and
            pepper, then add to the skillet. Cook until golden brown and cooked through, about 5-7 
            minutes. Remove chicken from the skillet and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            In the same skillet, melt the butter. Add minced garlic and red pepper flakes (if using) 
            and sauté for about 1 minute until fragrant.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour in the white wine (if using) and lemon juice. Allow it to simmer for a few minutes to
            reduce slightly. Add the chicken broth and simmer for another 2-3 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Return the cooked chicken to the skillet, tossing to coat in the sauce. Stir in chopped 
            parsley and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
            If using pasta, add it to the skillet and toss to combine. Serve hot, garnished with extra
            parsley and grated Parmesan cheese if desired.
        </li>
    </ol>
